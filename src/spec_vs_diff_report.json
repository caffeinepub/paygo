  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend user listing logic and frontend user display components. The backend changes appear to address listing all users without artificial limits, and the frontend shows proper rendering of user count and table rows. However, the diff is heavily truncated, making it difficult to verify if pagination/limit removal was explicitly implemented.",
